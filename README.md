homoplasy-paper
===============

A paper exploring comparative levels of homoplasy &amp; homoplasy metrics, in morphological datasets across many different taxa

* Using 1200+ morphology-based matrices from Graeme Lloyd, MorphoBank, and my own collection
* Equal-weights Maximum Parsimony analyses, in TNT, with original character ordering preserved
* Exploring homoplasy relative to many different factors e.g. missing data, number of taxa, number of characters, inclusion of fossil taxa, between different clades, between different versions of the same essential matrix etc...
