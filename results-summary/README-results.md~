Column C
The ensemble Restriction Index of the whole dataset, excluding uninformative characters

Column D
The length of the shortest MPT(s)

Column E
The number of MPT(s) found by analysis with TNT ( xmult=level10 + bb )

Column F

Column G
The Total Support Index of the whole dataset, excluding uninformative characters

Column H
The Proportional Support Index of the whole dataset, excluding uninformative characters

Column I
The mean of all per character consistency indices, for each informative character in the dataset

Column J
