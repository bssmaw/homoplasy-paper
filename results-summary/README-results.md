More studies will be added, their inter-relationships (overlap!) and other metadata need to be added.

Column E
The number of MPT(s) found by analysis with TNT ( xmult=level10 + bb )

Column F
The shortest possible tree given the characters and their state changes

Column G
The Total Support Index of the whole dataset, excluding uninformative characters

Column H
